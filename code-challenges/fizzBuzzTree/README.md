# FizzBuzzTree
It's a function that takes a tree, and "fizz-buzzes" each node in the tree (multiple of 3? fizz. Multiple of 5? buzz. Multiple of 15? fizzbuzz. Else? same value)

## Approach & Efficiency
Wrote a function that uses the preOrder method to fizzbuzz each node, then returns the tree.

## API
### fizzBuzzTree(tree)
