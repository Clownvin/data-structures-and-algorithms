# Max-Tree
It's a tree implementation that has a findMaxValue function, which will find the max value.

## Challenge
* Extend your BinaryTree class according to the feature tasks below
* Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
I used the reduce method that I wrote previously to simply reduce over the tree to find the max value.

## API
### findMaxValue()
Returns the largest value in tree using a reduce.
