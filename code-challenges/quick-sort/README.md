# Challenge Summary
Complete a working, tested implementation of Quick Sort, based on the pseudo code provided  
Create a blog post on understanding the Quick Sort Algorithm suitable for a 301 level student. Alternately, prepare a presentation that presents the algorithm in a novel way. E.g. a short skit, live mini-lecture, interpretive dance.

## Challenge Description
Ensure your complete solution follows the standard requirements.  

Write unit tests  
Follow the template for a well-formatted README  
Submit the assignment following these instructions  
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language  
Present a complete set of working tests  
Create a BLOG.md document using the template provided  
1 short video resource  
2 quality readings/references  
An organized, ordered blog outline  

Working pseudo code  
Description of the algorithm  
Supportive Images  

## Approach & Efficiency
It's a typical quick sort. Worst case is O(n^2), but it's average performance is O(nlog(n)). It's important to note that, unlike merge sort, quick sort is in place, giving it a space complexity of O(n).
